<p>A diabetic needs to draw blood in order to get a blood glucose reading. This reading is necessary to determine the proper insulin dosage at any given time. In order to help preserve one's fingers, it is important to test more or less evenly, but it is quite difficult to test in a truly random fashion, which is where this utility comes in. Basically, Finger Wheel is a tool that allows a user to keep track of their last tested finger. There is also a set of options allowing the user to disable certain fingers in case they can't use them for any reason. The name "Finger Wheel" comes from the original, physical prototype, which was in the shape of a wheel. It would spin to advance. </p>
